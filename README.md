# Manual for Assignment 2 submission

In this assignment, you can submit by doing things as explained below:
- Create a directory of all lowercases without space of your name, but only two words allowed at most. Between words there shall be "_". Let's call this directory as your personal space. 
- For assignment 2, the submission items are two screenshots. From [1](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-kotlin/course) and [2](https://developers.google.com/profile)
- On the second link please take a record of "My Profile" badges in the form of image. Please ensure all pictures recording are taken with your own username. 
- Set the first image as "kotlin_badge.png", and the second image naming with "developer_badge.png". Ensure you saved them with PNG. 
- Put both images into your personal space. 
- Create a readme.md, which state your Google Developer Account name. 

That's all. Simple aren't they?. But do be careful when submitting, since it's possible to be conflict with others when committing. Resolve the commit conflict yourselves. 
We can see which user are to causing the problem in order to subtract the score or possily reject your submission.
